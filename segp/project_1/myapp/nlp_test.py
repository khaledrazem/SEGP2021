data = "A numerical analysis on the effect of different architectures of membrane, CL and GDL layers on the power and reactant transportation in the square tubular PEMFC. The article discusses an architectural and methodological approach to the implementation of strategic procurement of transport resources, which form the aggregate capacity for operational planning and the subsequent implementation of the transportation plan in the operational interval for companies that transport goods for their own needs: industrial and trade - Retail and Wholesale. The future need for transport resources is determined because of finding an option that satisfies all divisions of the company that ensure the achievement of target KPIs. The S&OP method is considered with a description of the key tasks that it allows to solve in transport resource planning. The component architecture is given, showing potential applications of the S&OP methodology in the general concept of strategic resource planning.In transportation architecture, wayfinding quality is a crucial factor for determining transfer efficiency and level of service. When developing architectural design concepts, designers often employ their visual attention to imagine where passengers will look. A saliency model is a software program that can predict human visual attention. This research examined whether a saliency model or designer visual attention is a good predictor of passenger visual attention during wayfinding inside transportation architecture. Using a remote eye-tracking system, the eye-movements of 29 participants watching 100 still images depicting different indoor scenes of transportation architecture were recorded and transformed into saliency maps to illustrate participants' visual attention. Participants were categorized as either “designers” or “laypeople” based on their architectural design expertise. Similarities were compared among the “designers'” visual attention, saliency model predictions, and “laypeople's” visual attention. The results showed that while the “designers'” visual attention was the best predictor of that of “laypeople”, followed by saliency models, a single designer's visual attention was not a good predictor. The divergence in visual attention highlights the limitation of designers in predicting passenger wayfinding behavior and implies that integrating a saliency model in practice can be beneficial for wayfinding design.Autonomous mobile robots emerged as an important kind of transportation system in warehouses and factories. In this work, we present the use of MECA cognitive architecture in the development of an artificial mind for an autonomous robot responsible for multiple tasks, including transportation of packages along a factory floor, environment exploration, warehouse inventory, its internal energy management, self-monitoring and dealing with human operators and other robots. The present text provides a detailed specification for the architecture and its software implementation. Future work will present the simulation results under different configurations, together with a detailed analysis of the architecture performance and its generalization for autonomous robot control.With the rapid advancement of technology, an increasing number of devices are being connected to the Internet and getting smart. Such advancement brings new challenges in the field of intelligent transportation system (ITS), including transferring of high data rates, providing rapid response system to users, addition of new devices, and their remote configuration. Thus, mobile information systems, along with intelligent multimodal mobility services, cope with such constraints and take significant benefit of the associated technology from emerging information and communication frameworks. Therefore, recent advancement in the field of telecommunication has witnessed increased interest in ITS, especially vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETS). Software-defined networks (SDNs) can also bring advantages to ITS due their flexibility and programmability to the network via their logical and centralized control entity. However, the bandwidth and continuous connection between ITS and SDN is still a challenge owing to the highly mobile nature of VANETS. Therefore, to address this issue, this paper presents a novel concept for enhancing the capabilities of ITS via the newly proposed 5G-based SDN architecture for ITS. The proposed system architecture is based on the following three function layers: sensing layer, relay layer, and core network layer. Continuous accessibility, via flexible and programmable features, is achieved through SDN features. In addition, high data rates and bandwidth are provided by the proposed 5G architecture. The simulation results show that the proposed system architecture achieves better results than the ad-hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol.Although many Public Transportation Control Systems (PTCS) were developed to support the management of public transportation systems, there is still a need to improve the capability of PTCS to deal with a variety of disturbance types, which may degrade performance (e.g. earliness/delay) and quality of service (QoS, e.g. punctuality, frequency and utilization). This paper extends our previous works on artificial immune systems to control Public Transportation Systems by means of buses (PTS). The main contribution consists in developing a distributed reaction mechanism based on the immune network theory and its related mechanisms, such as cell co-stimulation, co-suppression, activation and coordination. The immune network reaction mechanism is implemented within a distributed multi-agent architecture, and its performance is assessed using traffic simulation software. The immune network reaction mechanism is benchmarked against other control strategies (holding at station, skip station, and their combination), and performance is evaluated based on three classes of criteria: time oriented criteria, passenger oriented criteria and service oriented criteria. The performance of the suggested system with respect to passenger and service oriented criteria was remarkably higher than the performance of other control algorithms. With respect to time oriented criteria, the performance of the suggested system was found slightly better than the combination of holding and skipping stations.As intelligent transportation systems are becoming more and more prevalent, the relevance of automatic surveillance systems grows larger. While such systems rely heavily on video signals, other types of signals can be used as well to monitor the security of passengers. The present article proposes an audio-based intelligent system for surveillance in public transportation, investigating the use of some state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods for the automatic detection of screams and shouts. We present test results produced on a database of sounds occurring in subway trains in real working conditions, by classifying sounds into screams, shouts and other categories using different Neural Network architectures. The relevance of these architectures in the analysis of audio signals is analyzed. We report encouraging results, given the difficulty of the task, especially when a high level of surrounding noise is present.The most salient problems of transit vehicle service in Latin American intermediate cities include: the high number of passengers involved in traffic accidents; traffic congestion caused by transit vehicles, and pollution generated by these vehicles, which increases in high congestion scenarios. To improve upon this situation, a research was conducted on the transit vehicle tracking service, which is a basic service for implementing mobility solutions for the aforementioned problems, the most relevant characteristics of this service for the context of Latin American intermediate cities were identified, and an implementation was proposed. This paper presents the four stages of the study: (a) a review of the state-of-the-art of services or systems related to vehicle tracking, including wireless communications technologies, implemented sustainability approaches, usage of special algorithms for efficiency improvement, and the intelligent transportation system (ITS) architecture used as a basis; (b) the process of identifying relevant characteristics of the service for a given context; (c) proposal of an ITS architecture for this service in an intermediate city, its requirements and the suggested technologies; and (d) development of experiments for validating usage of the key suggested technologies. The review allowed to identify the main service characteristics, with regard to vehicle positioning technologies, the recommended wireless communication technology (long range, LoRa), energy consumption considerations, and use of artificial intelligence (AI) to calculate waiting time of users at bus stops. Finally, an ITS architecture for the city of Popayán (Colombian city) considering the aforementioned characteristics is proposed, and the experiments related to the use of these technologies are described in detail. Architecture is the fundamental structure of a system. That structure is based on the relationships among the modules that provide the behaviour of the system. These structures appear, with variations, in many systems that address related problems. Because software is so malleable, much of this variation is implemented in the software portion of the product. These different architectures have different performance characteristics such as different levels of reliability and safety. In this chapter we will survey some of the popular architectures for cyber-physical systems, the quality attributes enhanced and degraded by each architecture and analysis techniques that are used to evaluate these qualities in the context of actual applications. Our intent is to provide the type of knowledge needed for the transportation engineer to participate in developing or acquiring software for smart transportation systems. Stable urbanization trends lead to the concentration of the population in large cities, as well as the expansion of the car fleet, while there is a colossal lag in the development of transport infrastructure. This article is dedicated to exploring traffic management and the ways in which it can be performed. Various approaches to defining a transport system were explored, and the elements of a transport system were presented. Existing practices of traffic management system implementation in cities around the world were reviewed. We formulated the main purposes of using traffic management and elements of traffic management systems. Based on that, a traffic management system architecture model was created.Architectural structural design of modern transportation software has a huge impact on a quality and cost of the development process, hence it's required to pay reasonable attention while making architecture design decisions. The technique proposed in this paper allows selecting the optimal software architecture among several alternatives. This selection technique is reduced to the criteria importance theory for decision-making problems with a hierarchical criterion structure. For applying it, we need to pick up a set of metrics that assess the characteristics of the software architecture. Next, we need to determine metrics scale and create the hierarchical criterion structure with all the relations between software metric groups.Crowd sourcing and sensing are relatively recent paradigms that, enabled by the pervasiveness of mobile devices, allow users to transparently contribute in complex problem solving. Their effectiveness depends on people voluntarism, and this could limit their adoption. Recent technologies for automating context-awareness could give a significant impulse to spread crowdsourcing paradigms. In this paper, we propose a distributed software system that exploits mobile devices to improve public transportation efficiency. It takes advantage of the large number of deployed personal mobile devices and uses them as both mule sensors, in cooperation with beacon technology for geofecing, and clients for getting information about bus positions and estimated arrival times. The paper discusses the prototype architecture, its basic application for getting dynamic bus information, and the long-term scope in supporting transportation companies and municipalities, reducing costs, improving bus lines, urban mobility and planning.A Vehicular Adhoc Network (VANET) is a generic communications conceptualization that can be applied to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and its main goal is to allow exchange of information between moving vehicles, fixed infrastructures, pedestrians with personal devices, and all other electronic devices able to connect to a VANET environment. Information exchange between different stakeholders brings a relevant potential to the development of applications to help users in different areas such as traffic safety and efficiency, infotainment and personal comfort. However, due to the expected heterogeneity (different processing power and storage capabilities, communications technologies and mobility patterns) and large scale on the number of devices involved, application interoperability in VANET contexts can be a challenging problem. Non-agnostic standard communications architectures for ITS systems have some deploying limitations and lack important specific implementation details. This paper presents an agnostic VANET architecture (it permits the use of several communication technologies in an open and modular framework), which is an adaption of present standards approach, to be deployed on ITS systems as a mean to overcome their main limitations.Several studies have shown that human transportation networks exhibit small-world structure, meaning they have high local clustering and are easily traversed. However, some have concluded this without statistical evaluations, and others have compared observed structure to globally random rather than planar models. Here, we use Monte Carlo randomizations to test US transportation infrastructure data for small-worldness. Coarse-grained network models were generated from GIS data wherein nodes represent the 3105 contiguous US counties and weighted edges represent the number of highway or railroad links between counties; thus, we focus on linkage topologies and not geodesic distances. We compared railroad and highway transportation networks with a simple planar network based on county edge-sharing, and with networks that were globally randomized and those that were randomized while preserving their planarity. We conclude that terrestrial transportation networks have small-world architecture, as it is classically defined relative to global randomizations. However, this topological structure is sufficiently explained by the planarity of the graphs, and in fact the topological patterns established by the transportation links actually serve to reduce the amount of small-world structure.Efficient port logistic operations and management are critical for global trade and transportation services. The current port logistic handling systems are highly centralized and offer limited opportunities for collaboration among diverse stakeholders. Moreover, existing systems fall short of providing traceability, transparency, information security, and immutability of data stored and exchanged during various operational pro- cesses. As a result, the productivity of port terminals is adversely affected. Blockchain is an emerging technology that provides traceability, transparency, auditability through immutable prove- nance data of on-chain trusted transactions, in a decentralized manner without intermediaries or trusted third parties. In this paper, we discuss the potential role of blockchain technology in transforming port logistic operations and services, provide use cases and frameworks that improve port logistics operations. Furthermore, we employ permissioned blockchain architectures to map port logistics services to highlight system components, participants, and deployment alternatives to automate logistics operations. Finally, we outline open research issues and chal- lenges that are barriers to adoptionIn the modern upgradation era, monitoring and control system is essential to ensure the smooth operation of the long-distance pipeline in the fluid transportation system. Now-a-days, to design an accurate online monitoring and control system represents a critical task that requires proactive planning in fluid transportation system. In the fluid pipeline system, the huge amount of fluid loss caused by leakages, cracks and blockages due to extreme pressure changes in the pipelines during transportation. The present research work focuses on developing Integrated IoT based intelligent architecture to perform online monitoring and control of pressure and flow rate in the fluid transportation system. The proposed Integrtaed IoT based architecture holds SCADA with LQR-PID controller as local control unit or local intelliegnce. During crack and leak occurrences in the fluid pipeline, SCADA with PID controller cannot afford desired control action due to drastic change in the pressure and the flow rate. Hence the entire architecture is monitored and accessed through high-level online server IoT interface to identify leaks and cracks in the pipeline at the initial stage before it leads to any catastropic situations. In order to attain better data communication between cloud server and pipeline hardware setup, smart IoT module is designed and fabricated. Once the crack or leaks is identified in the IoT front end, immediately emergency shut off is activated by the cloud server through smart IoT module by stopping the pump. The developed Integrated IoT architecture is experimentally validated in real-time lab-scale fluid transportation pipeline system. Further in this present work, the performance of Linear Quadratic Regulator-PID controller to regulate pressure and flow rate of the fluid being tansported is analyzed by comparing with convnetional controllers like Internal-Mode controller and Zigler–Nichols controller.The article considers the intellectualization basics with regard to multimodal transportation systems and strategies for its further development. The authors define the concept of the cognitive cycle of a transportation system, present its structure, and determine specifics of its use for the implementation of cognitive multimodal transportation systems. Primary components of an intelligent transportation system are identified through the example of a motor transport subsystem. The authors also consider specifics of forming the architecture of cognitive network transport infrastructures, their stratified and procedural representation.Transportation systems are increasingly complex and must evolve to incorporate components of sustainable development. It has become appropriate to develop high-level simulation tools for policy makers so that they can analyze the potential consequences of their choices. In this paper, we propose a decision-maker simulator intended to define and tune urban transportation policy (travel, parking and transportation strategies). In terms of system architecture, we adopted a “system of systems” approach, mainly structured in layers, in order to model the main elements of the system. We represent explicitly, for example, a layer of roads, lights, parking, means of transport, etc. Our system uses an agent-based simulation incorporating spatial and temporal information. It must support the regulatory scenarios to simulate the effect of regulatory strategies on transportation systems. The paradigm of multi-agent systems is well suited for simulating the behavior of the components of an urban transportation system. Existing applications address problems of individual behavior management, management of traffic flows, management of temporal and geographical aspects, multi-modality transport, etc. However, they don’t address organizational aspects of transportation systems that incorporate the adaptability of users’ behavior. In addition, we implemented the mechanism of “traces”; the trace files contain the result of simulation. Travel surveys, census and traffic measurements were used. Analysis of available data and traces were used to evaluate the suitability of our simulations according to different regulatory strategies. Finally, we implemented a prototype for the movement of people in the city of La Rochelle from statistical data of INSEE (the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) and the BD TOPO 2 of the IGN (the French National Geographical Institute) using the GAMA platform.The paper regards scientific, technical, and organization problems in the simulation of complex interdependent systems in the transport domain. It is dedicated to software architecture for HLA (High Level Architecture) interactive simulation providing a mechanism for an implementation of network-centric approach (NCA). The publication presents a structural methodology for integration of separate software simulations into a common information and communication environment. The effect from the network-centric simulation is an opportunity for obtaining Common Operational Picture (COP), which is able to provide shared awareness and increased speed of command in the transportation systems.This paper offers the description of an integrated information system framework for the assessment of transportation planning and management. After an introductory exposition, in the first part of the paper, a broad overview of international experiences regarding information systems on transportation is given, focusing in particular on the relationship between transportation system's performance monitoring and the decision-making process, and on the importance of this connection in the evaluation and planning process, in Italian and European cases. Next, the methodological design of an information system to support efficient and sustainable transportation planning and management aiming to integrate inputs from several different data sources is presented. The resulting framework deploys modular and integrated databases which include data stemming from different national or regional data banks and which integrate information belonging to different transportation fields. For this reason, it allows public administrations to account for many strategic elements that influence their decisions regarding transportation, both from a systemic and infrastructural point of view.This study aims to investigate the defensible character of the Lahore railway station built in response to “the war of independence in 1857,” which greatly impacted the location and design of the building. This study demonstrates the integral role played by the railway station in the development of the new colonial city, which the British wants to be defensive in every aspect. Railways were introduced in Pakistan (India) soon after their inauguration in Britain. Beginning from the mode of transportation, the multifaced contribution of railways toward the urban growth, new architectural style, mode of construction, and technology cannot be recanted. The research is based on the documentation and analysis of the history of Lahore railway station design. First, this study uses primary and secondary data to offer a history of the Lahore railway station from its inception to final execution. Second, it explores the criteria adopted by the British for its site selection to make the station a defensible post. The research finding includes the visual features that enhanced the architectural character of the building. Qualitative methods are used including several other approaches, namely, literature review, archival data collection, analysis of photographs, and study of architectural drawings and old maps, to achieve the objectives.Exploration of the Solar System is constrained by interplanetary transfer technology. Current propulsion architectures do not allow for trajectories much faster than Hohmann transfers, implying elevated health risks and mission costs associated with multi-year human spaceflight missions and even longer robotic mission times. Proposed advanced nuclear and exotic systems involve immature component technologies and high degrees of complexity, cost, and risk. Breakthrough improvements may be possible with electric propulsion powered by directed energy, where a large-aperture laser phased array directs energy to photovoltaics on electric propulsion vehicles. Narrowband intensity gain over sunlight would lower onboard power system specific mass (kg/kW) to enable fast Solar System missions without advanced nuclear or exotic power and propulsion systems. The proposed architecture is modular and offers scalability from nanosatellites to human missions, with opportunities for operational systems and Solar System exploration along a technology development roadmap.Nuclear energy is one of the most strategically important areas in the majority of countries today. Therefore, the issues of transportation of nuclear waste related primarily to security and quality are the most acute problems in this industry. This article discusses the key aspects and tasks related to ensuring the security of the transportation and disposal of nuclear waste, an analysis is made from the point of view of regulation of this industry in various countries. Moreover, the technological support of this process is considered. In this regard, the issue of forming an integrated approach to organizing the transportation of nuclear waste is relevant, which includes various aspects: organizing business processes, organizing IT services and organizing infrastructure. The result of this study is a list of requirements for a reference model for the transportation of nuclear waste, which can potentially be used as an industry standard in different countries.Today there is a great scientific interest in the development of the Russian Arctic, as one of the most attractive and promising areas in terms of hydrocarbon production potential. Oil production projects in the Arctic shelf are extremely capital intensive. Their successful implementation requires solving a number of tasks to overcome many existing barriers and challenges that oil and gas producers face today. One of such problems is the task of choosing an optimal hydrocarbon transportation route and creating an effective transportation and logistics system for offshore fields. The article gives examples of Arctic projects being implemented today, analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of various methods of oil transportation currently used, and describes an intelligent digital system of Arctic logistics management, the implementation of which is designed to improve the efficiency of transport and logistics system for offshore fields in the Arctic.Resilience offers a broad social-technical framework to deal with breakdown, response and recovery of transportation networks adapting to various disruptions. Although current research works model and simulate transportation resilience from different perspectives, the real-world resilience of urban road network is still unclear. In this paper, a novel end to end deep learning framework is proposed to estimate and predict the spatiotemporal patterns of transportation resilience under extreme weather events. Diffusion Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network and a dynamic-capturing algorithm of transportation resilience jointly form the backbone of this framework. The presented framework can capture the spatiotemporal dependencies of urban road network and evaluate transportation resilience based on real-world big data, including on-demand ride services data provided by DiDi Chuxing and grid meteorological data. Results show that aggregate data of related precipitation events could be used for transportation resilience modeling under extreme weather events when facing sample imbalance problem due to limited historical disaster data. In terms of observed transportation resilience, transportation network demonstrates different characteristics between sparse network and dense network, as well as general precipitation events and extreme weather events. The response time is double or triple of the recovery time, and an elastic limit exists in the recovery process of network resilience. In terms of resilience prediction, the proposed model outperforms competitors by incorporating topological information and has better predictions of the system performance degradation than other resilience indices. The above results could assist researchers and policy makers clearly understand the real-world resilience of urban road networks in both theory and practice, and take effective responses under emergent disruptive events.In this paper a numerical analysis was applied to evaluate performance of square tubular Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) with three different architectures of catalyst (CL), membrane and gas diffusion layer (GDL). Three different cases were investigated for cathode and anode which are square peripheral (SP), square chordal (SC) and square bisectors (SB). Commercial computational fluid dynamic code (CFD) was employed for solving conservative form of continuity and momentum, species transportation and energy equations. The obtained polarity curve was validated with experimental data for base model and then, this curve and the related power density was compared with conventional base PEM fuel cell model. The results indicated that all of the three square tubular architectures with different layers have better performance compared to base model and higher current densities could be achieved via these architectures. Among the three mentioned cases, SC had the highest current density and power density compared to SP and SB cases. SC had also higher hydrogen and oxygen consumption compared to two other cases because of uniform reaction in allover the area and elimination of regions in which the reaction is slow (i.e. Dead zone). The results showed the amount of hydrogen consumption at the cathode along the channel for SP, SC, SB cases 63.8%, 94% and 79.16% respectively, relative to input hydrogen amounts. Also, comparison of water concentration values for three SP, SC and SB cases showed 35.6%, 49.5% and 43.57% of inlet values respectively. This confirms that reaction taken place in SC is maximum. This research proves that, higher power densities could be achieved by employing different geometries and different arrangement of layers, which could considerably reduce the cost while improving efficiency of tubular PEM's."
